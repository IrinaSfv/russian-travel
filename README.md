### Landing page about popular travel destinations in Russia.

In this project, I've:
* built the page based on a design layout in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5S2WSbEFL6awjVWJ0NWL8Q/Sprint-3_-Russia-_-desktop-mobile?node-id=28503%3A0),
* checked the accuracy of the layout in Pixel Perfect, 
* deeply studied FlexBox and Grid and used them in the project,
* made the page adaptive for different devices from mobile to large screens.

## Installation
* Run `GitBash` (or `Terminal` on MacOS);
* Select or create a new repository where you want to put the project;
* Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/IrinaSfv/russian-travel.git`;
* Open the project in any convenient code editor.

## Usage
You can view the current version of the page by following the link:
### [Russian Travel Landing page](https://irinasfv.github.io/russian-travel/)

## To-do
* Add the English version of the page and the switch functionality between languages.
